You can read the details here on the Microsoft website: 
[Exam AZ-203: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-AZ-203.aspx)

## Getting Started
Azure can be quite intimidating because of the vast amount of services and options.
Therefore it would make sense to choose a specific learning path in order to learn how Azure can be used within the area you work in.
I would recommend everyone getting started with Azure to visit the [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/) portal. The portal is a great resource for getting familiar with services in Azure.

The exam consists of these areas:
* Develop Azure Infrastructure as a Service Compute Solutions (10-15%)
* Develop Azure Platform as a Service Compute Solutions (20-25%)
* Develop for Azure storage (15-20%)
* Implement Azure security (10-15%)
* Connect to and Consume Azure Services and Third-party Services (20-25%)

Each area will be described with links to the individual subjects.

## Flash Cards (Tinycards) for Practicing

I have created a set of Tinycards to help you practice for the exam. However, the exam does require you to code. The cards will therefore only be for yourself to practice knowledge regarding central concepts of the subjects.
